# Temporal Reasoning in a Compiler Chain

- Replibuild emits temporal data to replicode ai with custom operands.
- This is bigger than ffi gen and build systems, temporal reasoning with replicode as a compiler and event driven ai that deals with
objects during runtime...... Intent understanding with operands? reasoning engine that can compile, and decompile....
needed for binding custom definitions made by other languages to bindings generated by build, replicode can reason the intent for the bindings and how to generate them on the fly, something i cant replicate in code logic currently
